Objective: Look to scrap data from popular ecommerce websites such as BestBuy, Target, Walmart for certain
items ( eg: laptops) on an hourly basis to scan and analyse if there are any patterns observable in terms of change in prices
on a site or between sites. Analysis should help uncover optimal timeframes for article purchases.

Motivation: As I began my graduate journey at UofI, I was in a dire need of a laptop and scrambling for good deals.
Often, I would see certain laptops having discounted prices on certain sites in particular time windows, albeit intermittent.
Thus, looking to gather this data on a regular basis to see any underlying patterns.

Core goals:
--Scrap data using requests/BeautifulSoup and create a dump of data -> Schedule this as a cron job to run multiple times/day.
--Take the above dump and clean the data to allow for certain analysis.
--Create a dashboard to showcase all this data through visualizations to understand the patterns( if any) and present the same.

Stretch goals:
--If for a certain date, we see multiple prices getting reduced, be able to answer the same with reason(holiday? if so, which one)
routine drop in prices?)
--Create a user framework that would allow user input of laptop specs, with which it could provide laptop recommenations
along with site/price to buy at( Eg output: You should be able to buy laptop_x at site_y on these days)
